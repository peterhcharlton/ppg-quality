# `CALC_SPECTRUM_METRICS` - Calculates power spectral density metrics.
##  Inputs
+   sig : a structure containing the PPG signal with fields:
    
     - v : a vector of signal values
     - fs : the sampling frequency in Hz
    
##  Outputs
+   rel_power : the ratio of the spectral power between 1 and 2.25 Hz, to that between 0 and 8 Hz.
