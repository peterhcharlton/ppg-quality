# `CALC_SIG_SIM` - calculates the signal similarity between consecutive pulse waves.
##  Inputs
+   sig : a structure containing the PPG signal with fields:
    
     - v : a vector of signal values
     - fs : the sampling frequency in Hz
    
+   beats : a structure containing the indices of beat onsets:
    
     - onsets : indices of onsets
    
##  Outputs
+   sig_sim : the signal similarity for each pulse wave specified by the onset indices.
    
##  Usage
The 'ppg-beats' toolbox can be used to obtain indices of detected beats: <https://ppg-beats.readthedocs.io/>
