# PPG-quality README

**PPG-quality** is a Matlab library of algorithms to assess the quality of photoplethysmogram (*PPG*) signals.

## Purpose
This software is designed to provide open-source algorithms for assessing PPG signal quality. The software is intended for use in research, and is therefore aimed at academic researchers.

## Getting Started
To get started, see the accompanying documentation [here](https://ppg-quality.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) (and in particular, the [Getting Started](https://ppg-quality.readthedocs.io/en/latest/toolbox/getting_started/) page).

## Further Information
